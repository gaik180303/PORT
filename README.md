# PORT

## Port Scanning Using Nmap with Multi-Threading

### Overview
This project is a high-performance port scanning tool built using **Nmap** and **multi-threading** in **Python**. It enables efficient network scanning by leveraging concurrency to enhance speed and reduce execution time.

### Features
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Uses Python's threading module to perform concurrent scans.
- **Nmap Integration**: Automates network scanning and analysis using the Nmap library.
- **Security Assessment**: Identifies open ports in target networks for security evaluation.
- **Optimized Execution**: Improves scanning speed by distributing tasks across multiple threads.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Nmap**
- **Threading**
- **Git**
